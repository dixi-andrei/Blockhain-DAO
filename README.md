# DAO for Animal Fundraising

This project implements a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** designed to facilitate fundraising for animal-related causes. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, the DAO enables users to contribute, propose, vote, and execute funding decisions in a secure, transparent, and automated manner.

## Features

- **ETH Contributions for Membership:** Users can become DAO members by contributing ETH.
- **Proposal Creation:** Members can submit funding proposals for animal-related causes.
- **Voting System:** A democratic voting mechanism allows members to vote on submitted proposals.
- **Automated Proposal Execution:** Approved proposals are automatically executed if they meet predefined thresholds.
- **On-Chain Transparency:** All actions are recorded on-chain using events, ensuring complete transparency.

---

##  Demonstration Workflow

1. **Connect Wallet:** Users connect their MetaMask wallet.
2. **Contribute ETH:** Members contribute ETH to join the DAO.
3. **Create Proposal:** Members submit funding proposals.
4. **Vote Proposal:** Members vote on proposals.
5. **Execute Proposal:** Automatically execute proposals upon reaching the required threshold.

---

## Security Measures

- **Permission Checks:** Modifiers ensure that only authorized users perform critical actions.
- **Duplicate Vote Prevention:** The system verifies and prevents duplicate votes.
- **Threshold System:** Proposals must meet a defined threshold before execution.
- **Fund Verification:** Ensures sufficient funds are available prior to transfers.

---

##  Possible Improvements

- **IPFS Integration:** For decentralized storage of detailed proposal information.
- **Governance Tokens:** Introduce tokens to represent voting power.
- **Timelock Feature:** Add timelocks to delay execution after proposal approval for added security.
- **Enhanced Proposal Analysis:** Develop a more robust interface for in-depth proposal reviews.
